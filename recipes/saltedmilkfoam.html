        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Salted milk foam is a frothy topping characterized by a velvety 
            texture and a unique balance of sweet and salty flavors. It's 
            typically made with a combination of milk (often with cream), 
            a touch of salt, and sometimes sweetener. The result is a light, 
            fluffy topping that can enhance the taste of various beverages 
            like milk teas, coffee, and even fruit drinks.
